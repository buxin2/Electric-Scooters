# Electric Scooter Projects

# Overview

Since 2018, I have been developing electric scooters to explore and refine my skills in electric vehicle design and motor integration. Starting with a 24V DC motor in my first model, I have since advanced to 48V brushless DC motors in later builds, creating more powerful and efficient scooters tailored for urban mobility.

# Technical Details

First Model (2018): My initial scooter featured a 24V DC motor, marking my entry into electric vehicle innovation. This model set the foundation for my future projects.

Upgraded Models:

In subsequent scooters, I integrated 48V brushless DC motors sourced from electric scooters, offering increased speed, efficiency, and improved range.
Design and Efficiency

Each scooter build has allowed me to enhance both performance and efficiency, with an emphasis on creating lightweight, eco-friendly vehicles that are ideal for short commutes and urban areas.
